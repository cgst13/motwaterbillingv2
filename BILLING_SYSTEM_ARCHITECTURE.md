# 📋 Billing Management System - Professional Architecture

## 🏗️ Component-Based Architecture

Following **modern React best practices**, the system is built with a modular, component-based architecture for maximum maintainability, reusability, and scalability.

## 📦 Services Layer

### `billingService.js`
Centralized API operations for billing management:

#### Bill Management
- `getBills(page, limit, orderBy, ascending)` - Paginated bill retrieval
- `addBill(billData)` - Create new bill
- `updateBill(billId, billData)` - Update existing bill
- `deleteBill(billId)` - Delete bill
- `getCustomerBills(customerId)` - Get all bills for a customer

#### Customer & Rates
- `getCustomerTypes()` - Get customer types with rates from `customer_type` table
- `getLastBill(customerId)` - Get customer's last bill for previous reading

#### Validation
- `checkDuplicateBill(customerId, billedMonth, excludeBillId)` - Prevent duplicate bills

#### Calculations
- `calculateBasicAmount(consumption, customerType)` - Calculate based on rates
- `calculateDiscountAmount(basicAmount, discountPercent)` - Apply discount

#### Statistics
- `getEncodingStats(billedMonth)` - Generate encoding statistics by barangay

#### Export
- `exportToCSV(bills)` - Export bills to CSV format

- State coordination
- Component integration
- Data loading

**Features:**

- Paginated bill list (50 per page)
- View all bills with customer details
- Edit and delete operations
- Export to CSV
- Status indicators (Paid/Unpaid/Partial)

✅ **Encoding Stats Tab**
- Embedded EncodingStats component
- Independent state management

✅ **Modal Integration**
- Add new bill
- Edit existing bill
- Pass shared data (customer types, surcharge settings)

✅ **Pagination**
- Next/Previous navigation
- Page count display
- Total records count

---

## 🎯 Why This Architecture is Professional

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
Each component has one clear purpose:
- `BillModal` → Bill CRUD operations
- `EncodingStats` → Statistics display
- `BillingPage` → Orchestration

### 2. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Service Layer** (billingService) → API & business logic
- **Component Layer** → UI & user interactions
- **State Management** → Localized to each component

### 3. **Reusability**
- `BillModal` can be used anywhere bills need to be added/edited
- `EncodingStats` can be embedded in dashboards or reports
- `billingService` can be used by any component

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Small, focused files (200-500 lines)
- Easy to locate and fix bugs
- Clear file naming and organization

### 5. **Testability**
- Each component can be unit tested independently
- Service functions can be tested separately
- Mock data easy to inject

### 6. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new components
- No file bloat (1000+ line files)
- Team can work on different components simultaneously

### 7. **Performance**
- React reconciliation optimized for small components
- Unnecessary re-renders minimized
- Lazy loading potential for future optimization
